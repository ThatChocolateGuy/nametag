## ⚠️ Known Issues

### 1. No True Speaker Diarization Yet

**Issue**: All speakers labeled as "Speaker A"
**Impact**: Can't distinguish multiple speakers
**Workaround**: Single-speaker POC works fine
**Future**: Integrate AssemblyAI for multi-speaker support

### 2. Batch Processing Delay

**Issue**: 30-second delay in name detection
**Impact**: Not instant recognition
**Reasoning**: Cost optimization, better context
**Acceptable**: For POC and typical use cases

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. Local Storage First

**Approach**: Started with local file storage
**Learning**:

- Simple file storage extremely reliable
- < 1ms latency beats any network call
- Easy debugging and backup
- Perfect for POC and single-user apps

**Recommendation**:

- Start with local storage for POC
- Add cloud sync only when needed
- File storage sufficient for most use cases

### 2. OpenAI Voice Recognition

**Feature**: gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize for voice recognition
**Learning**:

- Voice biometrics work surprisingly well
- 7-second reference clips sufficient
- Automatic speaker ID without training
- Cost-effective ($0.002/min of audio)

**Recommendation**:

- Voice recognition > speaker diarization
- Start with OpenAI's built-in capabilities
- Store voice references from day one

### 3. Bun Runtime

**Challenge**: User switched from Node to Bun mid-project
**Learning**:

- Bun hot reload is fantastic for development
- Mostly compatible with Node packages
- Some subtle differences (fetch behavior, SSL)
- 2x performance improvement

**Recommendation**:

- Use Bun for development (hot reload)
- Test both Bun and Node for production
- Document runtime requirements clearly
