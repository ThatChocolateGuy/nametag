## 🚀 How It Works

### The Flow

```
1. Person speaks → "Hi, I'm John Smith"
   ↓
2. Smart Glasses capture audio
   ↓
3. MentraOS transcribes to text
   ↓
4. App buffers transcription
   ↓
5. Every 30s: GPT-4o-mini analyzes for names
   ↓
6. Name found → Store in local JSON file
   ↓
7. Display: "Nice to meet you John Smith!"

--- Next Session ---

8. Person speaks → "Hello, I'm John Smith"
   ↓
9. App queries local storage
   ↓
10. Person found with history
   ↓
11. Display: "Welcome back John Smith! Last: discussed vacation plans"
```

### Name Detection Examples

The system recognizes these patterns:
- "I'm John"
- "My name is Sarah"
- "This is Mike"
- "Call me Alex"
- "I go by Sam"

### Smart Recognition

When you meet someone again:
1. System detects name in conversation
2. Queries memory for that name
3. Retrieves last conversation details
4. Shows personalized welcome with context

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Decisions

### Why This Architecture?

1. **Modular Services**: Each service has a single responsibility
   - Easy to test individually
   - Can swap implementations
   - Clear interfaces

2. **MentraOS Built-in Transcription**: For POC
   - Simplifies initial implementation
   - Reduces cost
   - Good enough for single-speaker scenarios
   - AssemblyAI ready for Phase 2

3. **Buffered Name Detection**: Every 30 seconds
   - Balances cost vs. responsiveness
   - Reduces API calls to OpenAI
   - More context for better accuracy
   - Configurable timing

4. **Local File Storage**: Simple and reliable
   - No external dependencies
   - Fast performance (< 1ms)
   - Easy backup and restore
   - Simple JSON format

### Technical Tradeoffs

#### ✅ Chose: MentraOS Transcription
**Pro**: Simple, free, already integrated
**Con**: No speaker diarization in POC
**Decision**: Good for POC, can upgrade later

#### ✅ Chose: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for Name Extraction
**Pro**: Excellent accuracy, very low cost, fast
**Con**: Requires API key setup
**Decision**: Perfect balance of quality and cost-effectiveness

#### ✅ Chose: Batch Processing (30s intervals)
**Pro**: Reduces API costs, more context
**Con**: Slight delay in recognition
**Decision**: Acceptable tradeoff for POC

#### ✅ Chose: TypeScript/Node.js
**Pro**: MentraOS native, great ecosystem
**Con**: Not Python (for pyannote-audio)
**Decision**: Correct for MentraOS, can bridge later

## 🎯 Current Limitations (POC)

### Known Constraints

1. **Single Speaker Focus**
   - Currently treats all speech as one speaker
   - MentraOS transcription doesn't provide speaker IDs
   - **Solution for Phase 2**: Integrate AssemblyAI

2. **Name Detection Delay**
   - 30-second batch processing
   - Not instant recognition
   - **Solution**: Reduce interval or use real-time processing

3. **Memory Search Simplicity**
   - Basic name matching
   - No fuzzy search
   - **Solution**: Implement fuzzy search in FileStorageClient

4. **No Voice Biometrics**
   - Can't identify speakers by voice
   - Relies on name mentions
   - **Solution**: Add AssemblyAI speaker profiles

### What's NOT Built (Yet)

These are prepared but not implemented:
- ❌ True multi-speaker diarization
- ❌ Voice profile matching
- ❌ Automatic speaker identification
- ❌ Cross-session speaker tracking
- ❌ Rich person profiles (photos, social media)
- ❌ Integration with contacts/calendar
- ❌ Smart reminders and follow-ups

## 🚀 Roadmap for Enhancement

### Phase 2: True Speaker Diarization (Next)

**Goal**: Support multi-speaker conversations

**Tasks**:
1. Capture raw audio from MentraOS
2. Stream to AssemblyAI for speaker separation
3. Map speaker IDs to stored persons
4. Display different names for different speakers

**Complexity**: Medium
**Impact**: High - enables group conversations

### Phase 3: Voice Biometrics

**Goal**: Automatic speaker recognition without names

**Tasks**:
1. Create voice profiles for known people
2. Use AssemblyAI speaker labels
3. Match new speakers to stored profiles
4. Silent recognition (no name needed)

**Complexity**: High
**Impact**: Very High - seamless experience

### Phase 4: Rich Context

**Goal**: Deep conversation understanding

**Tasks**:
1. Extract action items and commitments
2. Detect emotional context
3. Link to calendar events
4. Integration with CRM/contacts
5. Smart follow-up reminders

**Complexity**: High
**Impact**: Very High - professional use case

## 💡 Usage Tips

### Getting the Best Results

1. **Explicit Introductions Work Best**
   - "My name is John Smith" → Excellent
   - "I'm Sarah" → Good
   - Casual mention → May miss

2. **Let It Buffer**
   - Wait 30+ seconds after introduction
   - More context = better extraction
   - Check terminal logs for confirmation

3. **Session Management**
   - End sessions properly (disconnect cleanly)
   - Conversation summaries saved on disconnect
   - Reconnect to test recognition

4. **Testing**
   - Test with yourself first
   - Try different introduction phrases
   - Verify memory persistence

### Debugging

**Check Terminal 1** for:
- "Name detected: [Name] (confidence: high)"
- "✓ Recognized: [Name]"
- "Stored new person: [Name]"
- API errors or connection issues

**Common Issues**:
- Names not detected → Check OpenAI API key
- Not persisting → Check file permissions on ./data/
- No transcription → Check microphone permission
- Display not showing → Check ngrok connection

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### API Usage Per Day

Assuming 10 conversations, 5 minutes each:

**OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini)**:
- Name extractions: 10 × $0.0003 = $0.003
- Summaries: 10 × $0.001 = $0.010
- Speaker matching: 10 × $0.0002 = $0.002
- **Subtotal**: ~$0.015/day

**AssemblyAI** (when implemented):
- 50 minutes audio × $0.02/hr = $0.017/day
- **Subtotal**: ~$0.02/day

**Storage**:
- Local file storage (free)
- **Subtotal**: $0

**Total**: ~$0.035/day = **~$1/month** for active use

### Cost Optimization

For heavy users:
1. Increase batch interval (60s instead of 30s)
2. Cache frequent recognitions locally
3. Already using most cost-effective model (GPT-4o-mini)
4. Batch API calls efficiently

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

### Easy Modifications

1. **Change Display Messages** (index.ts:54, 91, 163)
   ```typescript
   "Nametag Ready!" → "Your custom message"
   ```

2. **Adjust Processing Speed** (index.ts:64)
   ```typescript
   const PROCESS_INTERVAL = 15000; // 15 seconds
   ```

3. **Customize Prompts** (nameExtractionService.ts:31, 89)
   - Modify OpenAI prompts
   - Adjust confidence thresholds
   - Change output formats

4. **Add Custom Events** (index.ts:69)
   ```typescript
   session.events.onButtonPress((data) => {
     // Handle button press
   });
   ```

### Advanced Extensions

1. **Add Person Metadata**
   ```typescript
   interface Person {
     name: string;
     speakerId: string;
     company?: string;
     role?: string;
     interests?: string[];
     // ... more fields
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Search**
   ```typescript
   async searchPeopleByTopic(topic: string)
   async searchPeopleByCompany(company: string)
   ```

3. **Create Reminders**
   ```typescript
   async addReminder(personName: string, reminder: string)
   async getReminders(personName: string)
   ```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy Considerations

### Current Status (POC)

⚠️ **This is a proof-of-concept** - not production-ready for sensitive use.

### Before Real-World Deployment

Must implement:

1. **Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt personal data at rest
   - Use HTTPS for all API calls
   - Secure API key storage

2. **User Consent**
   - Explicit consent for recording
   - Clear privacy policy
   - Data retention policies

3. **Access Control**
   - User authentication
   - Authorization for memory access
   - Multi-user support

4. **Compliance**
   - GDPR compliance (if EU users)
   - CCPA compliance (if CA users)
   - Data portability
   - Right to deletion

5. **Audit Logging**
   - Track data access
   - Monitor API usage
   - Security event logging
